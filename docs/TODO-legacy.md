## React reliability and performance batch (2026-07-24)

This section records the current React/Supabase implementation. Older sections
below include historical notes for the legacy `public/` frontend; keep them for
audit context, but use this section for current production-readiness priorities.

### Fixed and verified

- [x] **Transient AI failures on the first request** — the shared
  `POST /api/generate` path now retries temporary Anthropic connection resets
  (`ECONNRESET`) and retryable 429/5xx responses with bounded backoff. Coach,
  assignment generation, student draft feedback, and teacher AI grading all use
  this protection. Exhausted transport failures return a clear retryable 503
  instead of exposing the raw socket error.
- [x] **Previous assignment rubrics missing from “Reuse previous”** — the React
  assignment builder now combines the durable rubric library with rubric schemas
  embedded in existing assignments, removes duplicates, and labels the source
  assignment. This covers rubrics created before the standalone library existed.
- [x] **Real submissions displayed under fake `student@aui.ma` identity** —
  teacher submission queries now include the profile email and the frontend
  normalizes it. Course/submission matching is UUID-first, so a missing email
  cannot split one real learner into a fake second roster row.
- [x] **Reopen falsely reported failure and could update before validation** —
  the teacher UI now awaits the asynchronous reopen operation, and the context
  validates current-attempt status/text before writing the reopened state.
- [x] **Student feedback note navigation and broken nested scrolling** —
  removed the redundant 1–4 and previous/next note controls. The complete
  highlighted paragraph uses one stable, smooth, bounded scroll area; students
  click or hover directly on a highlight.
- [x] **Student notification panel had an incompatible nested scrollbar** —
  removed the small fixed-height notification scroller so the panel follows the
  dashboard layout.
- [x] **Final submission stuck on “Submitting” / appeared to need a second
  click** — submission now uses reactive loading state, a synchronous duplicate
  click guard, a bounded wait for pending autosave, and a 30-second final-request
  timeout. Success and failure both release the loading state.
- [x] **Courses/submission state appeared only after repeated refreshes** —
  fixed a frontend race that committed courses, assignments, and submissions in
  stages while focus/storage listeners could reload a partial snapshot. The
  student workspace now runs one synchronization job at a time and commits one
  complete UUID-scoped backend snapshot atomically.
- [x] **Misleading empty dashboard during startup/outage** — added an explicit
  workspace loading screen and a non-destructive refresh error banner. A failed
  refresh keeps the last confirmed workspace instead of presenting it as empty.
- [x] **Inconsistent ordinary API failure behavior** — authenticated GET requests
  now share a 20-second timeout, bounded retry policy for network/429/502/503/504
  failures, and the existing single shared 401 session-refresh behavior.
- [x] **Excessive student review polling** — reduced the fallback review poll
  from every 2 seconds (30/minute) to every 15 seconds (4/minute). Focus and
  reconnect refreshes remain immediate.
- [x] **Every role downloaded one large React bundle** — route-level lazy loading
  now splits student, teacher, admin, landing, and auth screens. The former
  ~1.05 MB application bundle is now a ~335 KB shared entry plus role chunks
  (student ~173 KB, teacher ~386 KB, admin ~68 KB). A student loads roughly 52%
  less uncompressed startup JavaScript and no longer downloads teacher/admin
  dashboards.
- [x] **Verification for this batch** — all 11 Node unit-test suites pass,
  `vite build` succeeds, and the focused tab/focus refresh browser regression
  passes. A read-only live Supabase audit confirmed the reported student retained
  approved KOK3880 and ENG6911 memberships and that the ENG6911 submission was
  stored successfully; the observed missing UI state was frontend synchronization,
  not database loss.

### Remaining — highest production priority

- [ ] **[P0] Make browser E2E a reliable deployment gate** — update the two
  remaining local fixtures that still seed `localStorage` as if it were the
  application database. Mock the current backend course/assignment/submission
  endpoints instead. Run the critical teacher→student→teacher flow and refresh /
  submit / reopen cases on every release, with timing-sensitive cases repeated.
- [ ] **[P0] Create a separate staging environment** — separate deployment URL,
  Supabase project, test accounts, Anthropic budget/key, email configuration, and
  monitoring environment. Never validate destructive or migration behavior
  against production student records.
- [ ] **[P0] Finish the draft-recovery boundary** — Supabase must remain
  authoritative for courses, memberships, assignments, submission status, and
  grades. Store only unsynced draft/replay recovery in IndexedDB under a
  student+assignment key, with visible Saving / Saved / Offline / Sync failed
  states and tested reconnect/conflict behavior.
- [ ] **[P0] Security/RLS regression suite** — prove students can access only
  their own submissions, cannot change grades/reviews, teachers can access only
  their own classes, and admin endpoints reject non-admin users. Include archived
  and deleted resources.
- [ ] **[P0] Database integrity constraints** — verify/add indexes for class
  membership, assignment class, and submission student/assignment lookups.
  Enforce valid statuses, unique course codes, foreign keys, and the chosen
  invariant for one current submission per student+assignment.
- [ ] **[P1] Privacy-safe Sentry integration** — add React and Express projects,
  source maps, release/environment tags, and alerts for submit/autosave/auth/
  workspace/AI failures. Send only internal UUIDs and operational metadata;
  scrub essays, chats, feedback, grades, names, emails, cookies, tokens, and
  request bodies.
- [ ] **[P1] Load and failure testing** — simulate 20–50 students autosaving,
  submitting, and requesting AI feedback concurrently; cover slow Supabase,
  Anthropic outage, offline/reconnect, session expiry, duplicate click, and
  refresh-during-submit cases.
- [ ] **[P1] Split the large React workspace contexts by state boundary** —
  extract focused course, assignment, draft/autosave, submission, feedback, and
  grading hooks/providers. Measure with React Profiler; merely moving lines into
  smaller files does not count unless unrelated consumers stop rerendering.
- [ ] **[P1] Replace review polling with realtime events** — use Supabase Realtime
  or a controlled server event channel for publish, grade, reopen, submission,
  and notification updates. Retain the 15-second poll only as a recovery fallback.
- [ ] **[P1] Automated deployment safeguards** — require lint, unit tests,
  production build, migration validation, critical browser tests, staging smoke,
  and explicit production approval. Document rollback and backup restoration.
- [ ] **[P2] Accessibility pass** — keyboard-only flows, dialog focus traps,
  screen-reader announcements, contrast, reduced motion, and direct access to
  feedback that does not depend on hover.
- [ ] **[P2] Production performance measurement** — capture LCP, INP, API
  latency, submit latency, and error rates in staging/production. Continue
  splitting the assignment builder, grade sheet, replay, and analytics only when
  measurements justify it.

## Security audit findings (pre-pilot, 2026-06-13)

Full read-only audit ahead of the 20–40 student pilot (~14 concurrent). No
cross-tenant data leaks found; the IRB data-layer grant changes broke no live
flow; student work is protected by synchronous localStorage persistence. Items
below are the residual findings, ranked by pilot impact.

### Fixed in the security batch (2026-06-13)

- [x] **Stored XSS in grade-sheet export** — `public/app.js:6163` interpolated the
  student-set display name unescaped into the chat log (every other field in the
  builder was escaped); fired in the teacher's browser on "Download student work".
  Fixed: wrapped in `escapeHtml(studentName)`.
- [x] **AI rate-limit burst hard-errored students** — `server.js` `/api/generate`
  relayed Anthropic 429/503/529 with no `retryable` flag, so the client never
  retried and every student got an instant error during a synchronized class
  burst. Fixed: map upstream 429/503/529 → retryable 429. Also bumped the client
  AI timeout (20s→25s) above the server's 20s Anthropic timeout to kill the
  tie-race that wasted near-20s responses.
- [x] **AI velocity breaker could 24h-lock a legitimate student** — `server.js`
  `checkAiVelocity`: `offences` never decayed and the velocity hit was recorded
  *before* the concurrency gate, so classroom congestion (busy-429s + client
  retries) pushed students toward the burst limit and its escalating cooldowns.
  Fixed: concurrency gate now runs first (busy-rejected calls don't count), and
  the escalation tier decays after 1h with no new trip (`AI_OFFENCE_DECAY_MS`).
- [x] **Self-registerable teacher accounts** — `server.js` signup took `role` from
  the body with no gate. Added an **opt-in** `TEACHER_SIGNUP_CODE` env gate:
  inert by default (no behavior change), and when set, teacher self-signup
  requires the code. **ACTION: set `TEACHER_SIGNUP_CODE` in Railway before the
  pilot URL is shared** (note: activating it blocks teacher self-signup via the
  current client form — existing teacher accounts are unaffected; create new
  teachers by calling the API with the code or temporarily unsetting it).
- [x] **Password reset landed on the marketing page, not the reset form** —
  `server.js` `/` route only swapped in the app (`index.html`) for `?join`, so a
  reset callback (`/?reset=1#access_token…`) fell through to `landing.html`,
  which has no recovery-token handling — the reset form never showed. Fixed:
  `/` now also serves the app for `?reset`. (Found during the dashboard fix
  below: with Supabase Site URL/allow-list corrected, the link reached
  praxiswrite.com but showed the landing page.)

### Manual config done / to do (Supabase dashboard)

- [x] **Supabase URL config fixed** — Site URL was `http://localhost:3000` with
  an empty redirect allow-list, so every reset email redirected to localhost
  (resets silently broken for everyone). Set Site URL = `https://praxiswrite.com`
  and redirect allow-list = `https://praxiswrite.com/**` (domain-locked, which
  also keeps the off-site-redirect finding closed).
- [ ] **Move Supabase Auth emails to Resend SMTP + rebrand** — reset emails
  currently send via Supabase's built-in test SMTP: unbranded ("Supabase Auth",
  "powered by Supabase"), heavily rate-limited, and landing in spam. Point
  Supabase → Authentication → SMTP Settings at Resend (host `smtp.resend.com`,
  port 465, user `resend`, password = existing `RESEND_API_KEY`, sender = the
  verified `NOTIFY_FROM_EMAIL` domain), then rebrand the "Reset Password" email
  template (Authentication → Email Templates) as Praxis. Raises the send rate
  limit and fixes deliverability before the pilot.

### Fix before / early in pilot

- [ ] **[HIGH] No rate limiting on auth endpoints** — `server.js` has no
  `express-rate-limit`/`helmet`; `/api/auth/signin|signup|forgot-password|refresh`
  rely solely on Supabase's limits. **Design note:** key any limiter by **email,
  not IP** — 14 students behind one university NAT share a public IP, so an
  IP-based limit would lock out a whole classroom at sign-in. Per-email (signin
  brute-force) + generous per-IP ceiling is the safe shape. Deferred from the
  batch because a misconfigured limiter is itself a pilot-breaking risk; needs
  testing against the real deploy.
- [ ] **[HIGH] E2E does not gate PRs / can't validate PR code** — the Playwright
  suite targets **production** (`baseURL || "https://praxiswrite.com"`, no
  `webServer` block), so a `pull_request` trigger would test prod (old code), not
  the PR. Real fix: add a `webServer` block that boots the PR's server with test
  Supabase creds (or a Railway preview deploy) and point E2E at it, then add the
  `pull_request` gate. **Pilot-week mitigation:** freeze merges to `main` during
  live sessions; rely on the post-merge smoke + manual login→write→submit→grade.
- [ ] **[MEDIUM] `restoreSession` logs the user out on a transient network error**
  — `public/auth.js:113-147`: the catch wipes the stored session on any thrown
  error (e.g. a `fetch` TypeError when a laptop wakes before WiFi), bouncing the
  student to login mid-class. Written work is safe (localStorage). Fix: on a
  network error (vs a parsed `data.error`), keep the session and soft-fail.
- [ ] **[MEDIUM] Unload flush has no `keepalive`/`sendBeacon`** —
  `public/app.js:1816-1823`: the `pagehide`/`beforeunload` sync is a normal fetch
  the browser aborts on close, so the final few seconds of writing-events may not
  reach the server until the student reopens on the same device. Bounded (text is
  in localStorage), but fix with `keepalive:true`/`navigator.sendBeacon`.

### Post-pilot backlog

- [ ] **[MEDIUM] Teacher grading list pulls full keystroke logs for the whole
  class** — `server.js:2317` `select('*, profiles(id,name)')`, no pagination;
  largest server memory spike. Select only list-view columns; lazy-load heavy
  arrays per submission.
- [ ] **[MEDIUM] Deploy hardening** — add `engines.node: "20.x"` to package.json
  (CI runs Node 20; Railway picks its own) and a `/healthz` route + Railway
  healthcheck (no health endpoint today, so Railway can't auto-restart an
  OOM-thrashing instance).
- [ ] **[MEDIUM] Server→Anthropic timeout race** — partly addressed (client now
  25s > server 20s). Consider making the intent explicit/configurable.
- [ ] **[MEDIUM] CSP is report-only** — `server.js:51-62` blocks nothing; promote
  to enforcing once inline event handlers are removed.
- [ ] **[MEDIUM] Open redirect in password reset** — `server.js:272-296` passes a
  client-controlled `redirectTo` to Supabase. Harmless **iff** the Supabase
  "Redirect URLs" allowlist is locked to the domain (see manual checklist); stop
  accepting the client value regardless.
- [ ] **[LOW] `error.message` leaked to clients** in auth/AI handlers (DB/internal
  details); harden like the submission handlers (generic message + `errorClassForLog`).
- [ ] **[LOW] Unauthenticated `/api/classes/:classId/invite`** leaks class +
  teacher name; account-existence leak on signin/forgot-password.
- [ ] **[LOW] Withdrawal-delete guards only `P1-S*` names** (`server.js:3240`),
  not test accounts or the "AWG 1001" pilot class — admin mis-click is
  unrecoverable. Extend the guard.
- [ ] **[LOW] No multi-tab session sync** — Supabase rotates refresh tokens; a
  student with two tabs can get logged out of both. Add a `storage` listener.
- [ ] **[LOW] `/api/rubric/parse` raw fetch has no 401 refresh** —
  `public/app.js:4504`: expired token → misleading "Could not read the rubric
  file." (teacher-only, pre-class).
- [ ] **[LOW] In-memory quota/velocity maps never prune** (`aiUsageByUser`,
  `rubricUsageByUser`) — negligible at pilot scale; add a periodic sweep before
  scaling.
- [ ] **[LOW] Rubric AI endpoints** (teacher, 10/day) aren't covered by the 200k
  input cap or velocity breaker; accept 5MB files.
- [ ] **[LOW] Research-layer hardening** — `writeWithRequestScopedFallback`
  catches RLS but not column-grant denials (latent footgun if profiles writes
  ever route through it); `research_deletion_log` insert failure is only logged;
  `fluency_summary`/`metrics` copied into the archive without a key whitelist;
  IRB helper functions (`sanitizeProfileForClient`, `sanitizeProcessAnalysisForViewer`,
  `archiveSubmissionsForDeletion`) are untested.
- [ ] **[LOW] Client load** — 31 separate `<script defer>` (~830KB unminified);
  Sentry loader is synchronous in `<head>` (consider `async`).
- [ ] Run `npm audit --omit=dev` before the pilot (not run in the audit sandbox).

### Manual verification checklist (could not be checked from the audit sandbox)

- [ ] **Supabase "Redirect URLs" allowlist** — confirm it's locked to the Praxis
  domain (gates the password-reset open-redirect severity).
- [ ] **Anthropic account RPM/TPM** — confirm it covers ~14 near-simultaneous
  `claude-sonnet-4-6` calls (determines whether the rate-limit path is hit).
- [ ] **Production smoke test** — manual login → write → submit → grade (sandbox
  egress blocked `praxiswrite.com`).
- [ ] **Live DB grants** — static audit verified migration/code consistency;
  confirm with `\dp profiles` / `submission_process_analyses` if convenient.

## Bugs

### Pilot session 2 — feedback (2026-06-23)

Captured from live pilot use. **Most items were fixed in PR #344** (each in its
lowest-risk form); the rest are deferred below.

**Fixed in PR #344**

- [x] **Rubric snapped to the top on every score change** — both `select-rubric-band`
  and the ±0.5 `bump-rubric-band` now preserve the `.rubric-pane-body` scrollTop
  (on desktop the rubric scrolls inside that pane, not the window), via a shared
  `commitRubricScoreChange` helper.
- [x] **Rail said "Graded" before the grade was sent** — `getRailStudentStatus`
  now shows an amber "In review" until `teacherReview.publishedReview` exists, then
  ✓ Graded (matches the student-visible gate).
- [x] **"Ignore AI score" + override to 0 still showed 16/20** — the
  `teacher-review-final-score` input had no handler; added one that writes
  `finalScore` (incl. 0) and updates the footer total live (no focus-stealing re-render).
- [x] **New annotations landed at the top, not inline** — `captureAnnotationSelection`
  now records a *validated* source-text offset (skipping injected badge/`<sup>`
  nodes); render prefers it and falls back to the substring scan, so existing
  annotations are untouched.
- [x] **Teacher "Refresh" didn't refresh the roster** — `refresh-assignment-statuses`
  now also re-fetches class members, not just submission statuses.
- [x] **Students didn't auto-enter the class on approval** — new visible-tab poll
  (`syncStudentMembershipPolling`, 30s, only while on the waiting screen) drops them
  in automatically once approved.
- [x] **Outline box mis-used for full drafts** — relabel + placeholder + hint make
  clear it's for short notes (copy-only; the read-only-until-"Edit outline" toggle
  is deferred).

**Deferred (higher-risk / out of scope)**

- [ ] **[PILOT] Rubric PDF upload still fails** — PR #343 only hardened the *error
  path*: unreadable / scanned / corrupt files → friendly **422**, multer failures →
  **413/400**. A valid PDF extracts fine in isolation (`pdf-parse@1.1.4`, Node 20),
  but the actual teacher-facing upload **still doesn't work** — root cause TBD
  (engine, deps, client contract all ruled out). Capture the *real* failure from a
  live attempt (status + body, or the offending PDF). Plus two UX gaps: (1) surface
  the server error to the teacher — the drop-zone `catch {}` in `uploadRubricFile`
  (`public/app.js`) swallows it into a generic message; (2) add a reliable loading /
  spinner state for the upload+parse round-trip.
- [ ] **Assignment setup: essay / assignment type doesn't match between the two
  sections** — pin down which two (likely "Format with AI" setup vs. manual setup,
  or the setup form vs. the formatted preview) and keep them in sync.
- [ ] **Email the teacher when a student requests to join** — reuse the Resend /
  notify path; deferred as higher-risk (touches the email path).
- [ ] **Clearer "awaiting teacher" message** — the waiting screen exists and now
  auto-refreshes on approval (#344); the copy could still be made more unmissable.

**Post-pilot follow-ups (from the 2026-06-23 Sentry "Not authenticated" report)**

- [ ] **401 on student boot → Sentry noise + forced re-login** —
  `loadStudentClassMembership` (`api-service.js`) throws on a 401 from
  `/api/student/classes`; `bootStudentWorkspace` catches it and `sentryCapture`s it
  ("Not authenticated"). Seen on Mobile Safari / iOS where the session token is
  evicted or expired (ITP storage cap, tab suspension), so a returning student's
  class-load 401s before re-auth. Fix: on 401, try `Auth.refreshToken()` once and
  retry; if still unauthenticated, route cleanly to login instead of throwing /
  capturing. Same family as the `restoreSession` transient-logout and no-401-refresh
  items below. No data loss today (work is in localStorage) — it's noise + a mildly
  annoying re-login.
- [ ] **Student-membership poll should back off on 401** — `syncStudentMembershipPolling`
  / `refreshStudentMembershipIfApproved` (`app.js`, added in #344) calls
  `loadStudentClassMembership` every 30s while on the waiting screen; if the token
  expires it makes futile 401 calls (caught to `console.error`, not Sentry). When
  doing the 401-refresh fix above, have the poll stop / back off on an auth failure.

**Post-pilot Sonar housekeeping (PR #344 warnings — non-gating, not in that diff)**

- [ ] **Deprecated `word-break: break-word` ×4** (`styles.css` ~919, 1076, 1100,
  2241) → `overflow-wrap: break-word` (behaviour-equivalent; clears the deprecation).
- [ ] **`.find` used as a boolean** (`app.js` ~5990, feedback pool) → `.some(...)`.

### High priority

- [x] **Ghost sign-in** — visiting the invite URL on a device with a stored teacher session auto-logged in as the wrong account. Fixed: non-student sessions are now signed out and the auth screen shown when opening `?join=classId`. *(PR #257)*
- [x] **Chat coach renders `**markdown**` as literal asterisks** — AI coach responses were passed through `escapeHtml` with no markdown conversion. Fixed: `parseCoachMarkdown()` now converts `**bold**` → `<strong>` and newlines → `<br>` for assistant messages only. *(PR #257)*
- [x] **Annotate function** — annotations were reported not showing in the grading area. Investigated: rendering path in `teacher-render.js` is complete (inline highlights + panel). Likely a display/scroll issue — needs manual recheck in staging.
- [x] **AI buttons double-pressable** — investigated: the `request-ideas` action has no rendered button in the current UI (dead handler). Feedback button has `draftFeedbackLoading` guard; chat Send has `chatLoading` guard. No change needed.
- [x] **"Final work submitted" message persists when switching to a different assignment** — was actually `ui.draftSaveMessage` ("Submitted successfully.") not `ui.notice`. Fixed: cleared on `switch-class`, `open-assignment`, and `student-assignment-select` handlers.
- [x] **Copy-to-notes then changing rubric deletes teacher's note** — Fixed: `use-suggested-comment` now writes the AI text into `submission.teacherReview.finalNotes` and persists, instead of only setting textarea.value. `select-rubric-band` also captures any in-progress notes textarea value into state before `render()` wipes the DOM.
- [x] **Paste violet highlight only fires on first paste** — Fixed: clipboards carry `\r\n` line endings but the textarea value is normalized to `\n`, so saved paste-event text never matched the submission text via `indexOf`/`slice` and the violet highlight was dropped (the "first paste" was just whichever paste happened to be single-line). `handlePaste` now normalizes `\r\n?` → `\n` at the source; `getPasteEvidenceItems` and `renderTextWithPasteHighlights` normalize when searching so legacy events highlight too.
- [x] **Clicking rubric sections causes page to jump** up and down. — Fixed: `select-rubric-band` handler now snapshots `window.scrollY` before `render()` and restores it immediately after, so the full-page re-render no longer shifts the teacher's scroll position. Mobile auto-scroll to next criterion still fires.
- [x] **Admin view counts deleted assignments** — Fixed: `admin-back-to-teachers` now refreshes `loadAdminData()` in the background so deleted assignments disappear from teacher counts. Also refresh after an admin-initiated `delete-assignment` action.
- [x] **Keystroke data deleted when class/assignment deleted** — Fixed: added a `public.submission_archive` table (admin-only RLS). The class- and assignment-delete endpoints now snapshot every affected submission (incl. `writing_events` + `keystroke_log`) into the archive *before* the hard delete, so writing-process data is preserved for algorithm training. Archive write happens first; if it fails the delete aborts (no silent data loss). Migration: `migrations/20260528_submission_archive.sql`.
- [x] **"Next: Write draft" button grayed out until second chat message** — Fixed: button is always enabled. If student clicks early (not enough chat / outline incomplete), a gentle `confirm()` modal asks "Are you ready to move on?" rather than blocking. Tooltip on the button still hints that chatting + outlining first helps.
- [x] **Teacher should be able to see and grade student's work even if submit was not triggered** — The infrastructure to grade unsubmitted work already existed (`ensureTeacherReviewSubmission` creates placeholders; `getSubmissionReviewText` falls back to `draftText`). Fixed: added a clear amber banner at the top of the grading panel when status isn't submitted/late/missing/graded but draft/final text exists: "In-progress draft. This student has not submitted yet, but you can still review and grade their current work."
- [x] **Writing behaviour label unexplained** — Fixed: added a `?` tooltip next to the status pill in the modern writing-process panel (`writing-process/render.js`). Tooltip explains all four labels (Typical process / Review suggested / Close review needed / Not enough writing data) and how severity is determined. The actual labels in code are these four — the TODO described them as "Likely natural / Uncertain / Needs review" from memory.

- [x] **Unexpected password-strength message** — Fixed: `shouldShowUpgradePrompt()` now also returns false for accounts created on/after the security hardening date (2026-05-01) — new signups never see the banner. Legacy accounts still see it until dismissed. *(Issue #110, PR #259)*
- [x] **Profiles RLS policy too broad** — Fixed: replaced `qual=true, roles=public` SELECT policy with `authenticated`-only. Unauthenticated users can no longer read profiles. Per-class scoping deferred to a follow-up migration. *(Issue #109, PR #259)*
- [x] **Submissions endpoints return 500 on auth/access failures** — Fixed: added `isRlsDenial()` helper; five submission endpoints now return 403 instead of 400 on RLS denial. Catch blocks no longer expose raw `error.message`; log `error.name` (class only) to avoid Sonar S5145. *(Issue #111, PR #259)*

### Medium priority

- [x] **What happens when a teacher deletes a class or assignment that had submissions?** — Fixed: submissions are now archived to `public.submission_archive` before deletion (see keystroke-data item above), so data is preserved not destroyed. The class- and assignment-delete confirmation dialogs were also reworded to make clear the work is removed from the dashboard and archived for research (no longer "permanently deleted").
- [x] **Sign-up by class link needs an "accept student?" gate on the teacher side** — Fixed: new joins via invite link land in `pending` state; teacher sees Approve/Decline in the roster; student sees a waiting screen until approved. Clicking a student name in the roster now navigates directly to their grading view (requires an assignment to be selected first). *(PR #267)*

---

## Tests / QA

- [x] **UI/integration test: complete a student submission against a 3-criteria / 15-point rubric** — covered: `tests/e2e/cross-role-smoke.spec.js` creates an AI assignment scoring ideas/organization/language (3 criteria) and runs a full student submission incl. self-assessment; the rubric-mismatch unit regression (`browser-utils.test.js`) covers the 15-vs-declared-20 total.
- [x] **Failed-submit protection test** — covered in
  `tests/e2e/student-workflow-local.spec.js`: a failed final submit keeps the
  draft editable, shows no false success, and releases the submit button.
- [x] **Draft persistence regression test** — covered by the student workflow
  focus/refresh regression, including continued typing and paste after refresh.
- [ ] **Teacher-receives-submission regression test** — outside the currently-skipped full-flow E2E test.
- [ ] **4-criteria / 20-point rubric regression test** — keep the normal rubric path covered.
- [ ] **Verify publish email fires only after server-confirmed publish** — and that a publish failure shows a clear failure message.
- [x] **Verify AI provider rate limits and concurrent request capacity** for pilot-scale usage (12+ students simultaneously).

---

## Features

### Teacher workflow

- [x] **Manual assignment creation needs its own Save button** — implemented: "Set up manually" mode has its own Save bar (`renderManualSaveBarHtml`, `renderManualProxyHtml` in `teacher-assignment-choice.js`); AI-assist and manual are independent workflows.
- [ ] **Add assignment type and min/max word limits to Format with AI setup** — currently these only appear after AI formats the assignment.
- [ ] **Notification when assignment is created and ready to publish** — teacher should see a confirmation message and a prompt to publish.
- [ ] **Save assignment button should change to "Saving…" on click**, then scroll to the created assignment in the tray, highlight the Publish button, and suggest publishing.
- [x] **Submit grade message** — Already implemented: submitting a grade sets the notice to "Grade submitted to student." and shows it in a green confirmation banner in the grading panel (`app.js` `save-teacher-review` handler + `teacher-render.js`).
- [~] **Suggest rubric score button** — Renamed "Suggest rubric scores" → "Suggest score" (`teacher-render.js`). Repositioning it below the collapsible "▶ Planning chat with coach" section (after the process/chat context, before the rubric rows) is deferred to the Phase A grading redesign, which restructures this panel.
- [x] **"1 paste flag" in assignment tray should be clickable** — implemented: pill is now a `<button data-action="open-paste-flag">` that loads the assignment's submissions, finds the first paste-flagged one, and opens grading for that student.
- [x] **Copy grade → rename to "Copy grade and feedback"** — Done: button relabelled in `teacher-render.js` with a `title` tooltip ("Copies the score, rubric breakdown, teacher feedback and annotation comments so you can paste them into your LMS."). Removed the now-stale runtime relabel in `teacher-ui-cleanup.js`.
- [ ] **Coaching chat under the heat map should show the student's Reflection ("what I improved")** so teacher sees the full process.
- [x] **Rubric score should be bumpable in 0.5 increments** — done: each grading criterion row has a ±0.5 stepper (`bump-rubric-band` action, ▲/▼ buttons in `teacher-render.js`) that nudges only that row's selected cell, plus a `step="0.5"` editable final-score input. Floor/ceiling clamp the band range.
- [ ] **Hide manual assignment setup box when in AI-support mode**.
- [ ] **Fix AI feedback** *(needs more detail — what specifically is broken?)*
- [ ] **Ability to accept or reject AI suggestions**.
- [ ] **Two reusable Praxis-supported writing task models** — listed as "Demo task" for every teacher when they set up a class.
- [ ] **Class rules** — when teacher creates a class, give them the chance to add class rules with a template suggestion.
- [ ] **Make sure test teacher/student assignment submissions don't skew keystroke data** — *flagging mechanism exists* (`is_test_account` + per-submission writing-behaviour exclusion in `admin-render.js`). Remaining: bulk-delete or auto-flag obvious test data so it never enters analytics in the first place.

### Student workflow

- [x] **"Graded work available" notification on student side** — implemented: assignment list rows show a "Graded" pill + "View feedback" button (direct to step 4); a "Feedback returned" card appears above the workspace when graded work exists but isn't selected.
- [ ] **Student assignment tray needs structure** — separate sections for new, submitted, and graded assignments. Look at how Canvas / other LMS organise students' assignments.
- [ ] **Make the assignment brief more obvious and unmissable** on the student assignment page.
- [x] **Toggleable: auto-generate outline after chat conversation** — done: teacher toggle `autoOutlineFromChat` (next to "Disable chatbot"). When on, the student draft page auto-builds an **editable** idea-outline (notes only, no sentences) from the coach chat, with a "Rebuild from chat" button. Logic lives in a self-contained `public/student-chat-outline.js` (kept out of app.js); outline text nests in the `submission.outline` jsonb so it persists with no submission-schema change. New `assignments.auto_outline_from_chat` column (migration `20260601_assignment_auto_outline.sql`).
- [ ] **Download "my work" filename** — should be `AssignmentName-ClassName-Date` not a generic name.
- [ ] **Remove student focus box from all workflows**.
- [ ] **Remove skip chat button** — *note:* the old `docs/todo.md` marked this done, but `skip-chat-to-draft` + the `chat-skip-notes` textarea are still live in `student-render.js`/`app.js`, so it is **not** actually done.
- [ ] **+code: Contraction field** — "don't" instead of "do not" should give 3 fields: 1. Error code, 2. Name, 3. Explanation (shown on hover).
- [x] **"Good sample" green highlight** — implemented: `GOOD` annotation code renders a green highlight + green card in the annotation list. A "✓ Good" button sits in the toolbar between the error codes and the Note button.

### Naming / labels

- [x] **Remove all mentions of "AUIZero"** — no UI-facing text remains; all remaining occurrences are localStorage/sessionStorage key strings (`AUIZero-v1`, `auizero_session`) which must not be renamed without a migration plan.
- [x] **Rename "Teacher notes" label → "Feedback for student"** — done: `teacher-render.js:1047` uses "Feedback for student"; student-side grading view already uses "Teacher feedback".

### Writing fluency / analytics

- [x] **All writing fluency items show scale bars** — the modern panel (`writing-process/render.js`) shows 4 metric cards (Typing rate, Long thinking pauses, Local revisions, Text survival), all rendered as scale indicators. The legacy `writing-behaviour-render.js` with 5 items (3 scale + 2 badge) is never shown when keystroke data exists. No action needed.

## Known minor issues (defer unless teachers complain)

- [ ] **Pre-save rubric header flicker** — the rubric panel header still shows the auto-total while the teacher is editing the Final score override input; it only updates after Submit grade. Could fix with an `oninput` handler on the override input that writes to a UI state field. Current behaviour is acceptable since the input itself shows what they typed.

---

## Open product decisions

- [x] **Attempt history** — decided and implemented: reopening edits the current
  attempt in place; a new attempt is created only when the student actually
  resubmits. The prior graded review is preserved as attempt history.

---

## Refactor / architecture

- [ ] **Continue modularizing only after pilot-critical bugs/tests are stable.**
- [ ] Consider `student-workflow.js` for step navigation, draft/final transitions, submit, and feedback request handlers.
- [ ] Consider `teacher-assignments.js` for create/edit/publish/delete assignment handlers.
- [ ] Consider `teacher-review.js` for grading handlers, annotation controls, and playback controls.
- [ ] Keep large render extraction for later; render functions are still tightly coupled to global state.
- [ ] **Enable Anthropic prompt caching on AI calls** (chat, draft feedback, grade suggestion). Requires restructuring prompt builders in `app.js` so static content (assignment context, rubric, system prompts) comes BEFORE dynamic content (student draft, chat history) — currently interleaved as template literals. Also requires updating `/api/generate` in `server.js` to support a `cache_control` field. Estimated savings: 50–70% on input tokens for cache hits (mostly grade suggestion + feedback during concurrent pilot use). Note: 2048-token minimum on Sonnet means short chat turns may not qualify. Best done during the prompt-builder refactor. Revisit when AI costs exceed ~$50/month.

## Performance & Lighthouse follow-ups

Deferred from the Lighthouse audit shipped in **PR #329** (instant first-paint skeleton, lazy-loaded `jszip`, text-contrast fixes, `<main>` landmark, login meta description, security headers). These were held out of that pilot-safe batch because they each need either a **build step** (the project deliberately has none) or the **Sentry dashboard token**.

- [x] **Code-split React role modules** — the Vite/React application now uses
  route-level `lazy()` imports for student, teacher, admin, landing, and auth
  screens. Build output confirms separate role chunks; student startup no longer
  includes teacher/admin dashboard code. The legacy `public/` script bundle is
  historical and should be retired rather than independently optimized.
- [ ] **Minify + content-hash static assets** — `app.js` / `styles.css` etc. ship unminified with no cache-busting filenames. Needs a build step. Lower value than it looks (the server already gzips via `compression`). If a build step is added, do minify + content-hashing + long `Cache-Control` together.
- [ ] **Sentry: lighten + stop render-blocking** — the loader in `index.html` / `landing.html` pulls the full tracing+replay+feedback bundle (~90 KB) and isn't `async`. Switch to an errors-only bundle (or lazy-load Replay/Feedback only inside the authenticated app) and make the loader non-render-blocking. Requires the Sentry dashboard / `sntryu_…` token, and the loader init-ordering (`onLoad` / `sentryOnLoad` hooks) must be validated against the live config so the feedback widget keeps working.
- [ ] **Enforce CSP + Trusted Types** — `server.js` currently sends `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`. Before flipping to an enforcing `Content-Security-Policy`: confirm the reported origins (`'self'`, Sentry CDN/ingest) from real violation reports, and remove the one inline `onclick="location.reload()"` in the boot-error path (`app.js`). Trusted Types (`require-trusted-types-for 'script'`) is higher-risk — add it Report-Only first, as a separate task.
- [ ] **Re-run Lighthouse to verify** — the contrast fixes (`--muted`, login active tab) are *calculated* to clear WCAG AA 4.5:1, not Lighthouse-verified in-environment. Re-run on the login + landing pages after deploy to confirm the A11y/SEO scores rise. Also audit the inner views (grading, student editor, admin) with DevTools Lighthouse **Snapshot** mode — they share the same URL and weren't covered by the cold-boot run.

- [x] Supabase admin/user client session separation *(PR #115)*
- [x] Playwright E2E test suite (auth ✅ teacher ✅ student ✅ full-flow skipped with reason)
- [x] Reopen submission flow: clears graded review fields server-side AND fixed `mergeStudentSubmission` so locally-cached graded state doesn't override the server's cleared state on reopen
- [x] AI buttons disable while thinking — prevents double-requests on assignment creation and student AI feedback
- [x] Regression test: pilot rubric mismatch (3 criteria / 15 points) does not block student submission
- [x] Rename "Suggest rubric scores" → "Grade with AI" (clearer action label)
- [x] Submit grade button disables + shows "Submitting…" during request
- [x] Show "Grade submitted to student" confirmation in grading panel after submit
- [x] Optional reflection textarea on self-assessment screen (non-blocking for submit)
